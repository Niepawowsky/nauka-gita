                <h1>Bille Jean</h1>
                <h6>by Michael Jackson was white</h6>
                <p>
                    She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
                    I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
                    Who will dance on the floor in the round</br>
                    She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
                    She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
                    Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
                    Who will dance on the floor in the round</br>
                    People always told me be careful of what you do
                    And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
                    And mother always told me be careful of who you love
                    And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
                    Who will dance on the floor in the round</br>
                    People always told me be careful of what you do
                    And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
                    And mother always told me be careful of who you love
                    And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
